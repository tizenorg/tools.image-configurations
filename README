Any global changes to configurations need to be done in the 
configurations.yaml file. Local changes need to be done in the individual yaml
files which are organised per vertical.

Do not make any changes directly to the ks files. If it gets complicated and a
certain scenario can't be done using kickstarter, please report a bug.

Updates to the git repositories have no effect unless they are packaged and
submitted to the build system.

- Edit yaml files and make the desired changes
- Verfiy integrity of the changes by running kickstarter as follows:

# kickstarter -c configurations.yaml -r repos.yaml -i index.xml


To update the package:
- change the yaml files
- Verify your changes
- Bump the version in the VERSION file
- commit and push
- Do not change the ChangeLog file, this is generated using a script
  run 'python scripts/gitlog2changelog.py'
- commit and push
- run 'make tag'
- run 'make dist'
- Submit the newly generated tar
